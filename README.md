**XRD**, XPS, **UV-vis**, FT-IR, SEM-EDS, TEM etc..

Welcome to my area
This page relate to Analysis equipment which I used to use before or study

## XRD

#### [XRD fitting data of ZIF(Zeolitic Imidazole Frameworks)-67 using Origin and high score plus]

The ZIF-67 was synthsized by using wet chemical method. And It was dried at vacuum oven at 80 degree(celcius) during overnight
The Data was obtained by using Brunker XRD which has Cu cathode as light source


#### [XRD fitting data of Cobalt Oxide]

The Cobalt Oxide was sysntehized after calcinating the ZIF-67 at 600 degree(celcius) under air condition

#### [NCM cathode XRD peak]

The data was plotted by Origin
To confirm the properties of NCM cathode which unidentifed, We use the Powder X-ray Diffraction at Yonsei Univeresity
By comparing reference data, We can confirim that this sample is Ni_0.65 Co_0.25 Mn_0.1

## UV-vis

## FT-IR
