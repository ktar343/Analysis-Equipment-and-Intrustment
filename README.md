**XRD**, XPS, **UV-vis**, FT-IR, SEM-EDS, TEM etc..

Welcome to my area. <br>
This page relate to Analysis equipment which I used to use before or study

## XRD

#### [XRD fitting data of ZIF(Zeolitic Imidazole Frameworks)-67 using Origin and high score plus]

The ZIF-67 was synthsized by using wet chemical method. <br> 
And It was dried at vacuum oven at 80 degree(celcius) during overnight. <br>
The Data was obtained by using Brunker XRD which has Cu cathode as X-ray source.


#### [XRD fitting data of Cobalt Oxide]

The Cobalt Oxide was sysntehized after calcinating the ZIF-67 at 600 degree(celcius) under air condition. <br>

#### [NCM cathode XRD peak]

The data was plotted by Origin. <br>
To confirm the properties of NCM cathode which unidentified, We use the Powder X-ray Diffraction at Yonsei Univeresity. <br>
By comparing reference data, We can confirim that this sample is Ni_0.65 Co_0.25 Mn_0.1 <br>

## UV-vis


## FT-IR
